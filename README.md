# discord-deferrals-card
Discord presence check with AdaptiveCards in connection deferrals <br>
This is a **code snippet**, not a ready-to-run resource.

## Usage
Just copy the desired code into your server side resource. **(Read the WARNING for more context).** <br>
Make sure to edit the two constants `TOKEN` and `GUILD_ID` in the config.lua. <br>
You can edit the content and style of the card to your liking, too. You also find that in the config file.

If you don't have or don't want a `config.lua`, make sure you move all the variables inside the main file, all of them above the code.
